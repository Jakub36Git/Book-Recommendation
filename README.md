# üìö Book Recommendation Project

This project explores how to answer the question:

**‚ÄúI like *The Lord of the Rings* ‚Äî what else should I read?‚Äù**

We approach this problem using collaborative filtering methods on the [Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset/data) from Kaggle, which includes over one million user-book ratings.

We develop and compare two recommendation strategies:
- **KNN-based similarity**: using book-user interactions and cosine similarity.
- **Lift-based recommendations**: identifying books that are disproportionately liked by specific user segments.

---

## Methods and Structure

- Data cleaning & segmentation (e.g., by author, title keyword, age group)
- Binary read behavior & rating-based modeling
- Lift metric based on relative user engagement
- KNN with cosine similarity
- Popularity penalization (to reduce dominance of bestsellers)

---

## Data Limitations

The dataset contains noise, inconsistencies (e.g., different book title/author variats), and missing metadata (age, rating). We perform only minimal cleaning, focusing on recommendation logic rather than advanced preprocessing.
